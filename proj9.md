Create a simple web application that allows users to customize some aspects of the page (like background color, text color, and font size) through a form. This customization should be stored in the URL query string (for initial settings) and also saved in cookies for future visits, ensuring that the settings persist across page reloads. Provide output to the user demonstrating this on each page

Customization Form: The form will let users select background color, text color, and font size.

Query Strings: The customization selections will be passed through the URL query string when the form is submitted.

Cookies: The preferences should be saved in cookies, and the userâ€™s previous preferences should be displayed when they revisit the page. Cookies should also be set to expire!

Display Customization: On the page load, the application should apply the user preferences to the page.
