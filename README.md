# SDC Club Website

Welcome to the SDC Club Website repository. This project is aimed at creating a dynamic and engaging website for the SDC Club.  This is currently being developed for the class CSCN 315: Front-end development in JavaScript, so some web elements may be created uniquely to fit specific assignment instructions.  Once the semester is over, this website will be modified to be used officially for the club.
